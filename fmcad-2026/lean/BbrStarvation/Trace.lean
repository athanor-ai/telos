  BbrStarvation.Trace
  Trace semantics for the BBRv3 finite-state abstraction.

  The transition function `step` is factored into five pure sub-steps so
  each sub-step is independently verifiable in Lean and maps one-to-one
  onto a SystemVerilog `always_ff` block for the EBMC cross-check.

  Sub-step definitions follow draft-ietf-ccwg-bbr-05, simplified where
  the draft's full machinery is not load-bearing for the starvation-onset
  theorem. The three iterations of refinement that produced the current
  statement are documented in the paper's meta-evidence section.

/-- Slide the min-RTT filter: shift each bucket's age by one and insert
    the new `ack_rtt_sample` at index 0. Stale samples at age `W - 1`
    fall off the window. Non-trivial: the update touches every bucket. -/
noncomputable def filter_update (s : BBRState W) (a : AckEvent) : BBRState W :=
  { s with
    min_rtt_filt := fun i =>
      if i.val = 0 then
        a.wall_clock
      else
        s.min_rtt_filt ⟨i.val - 1, by
          have : i.val < W := i.isLt
          omega⟩
    rt_elapsed := s.rt_elapsed + a.wall_clock }

/-- Update the bottleneck-bandwidth estimate from the delivered-rate
    sample. The draft uses a max-over-window filter
    (draft-ietf-ccwg-bbr-05 §4.4, 10-round window); an earlier
    iteration of this function used an all-time running max on
    `pacing_rate`, which was refuted by a concrete counterexample
    because any positive `delivered` sample permanently lifted
    pacing_rate and the starvation predicate `pacing_rate = 0`
    became unreachable.

    The fix threads a parallel `bw_filt : Fin W -> Real` on `BBRState`.
    Each invocation slides the filter by one age bucket, inserts the
    new sample at index 0, and recomputes `pacing_rate` as the max
    over the W-wide window. Stale samples at age `W - 1` fall off,
    which lets the window drain to zero within `W` ticks after the
    ACK stream stops. -/

  -- Max over the W-slot window. Uses `List.foldr max 0` rather than

  -- delivered-rate samples are nonneg).

    drains, phases 2-7 cruise at unit gain. -/

                         (bandwidth_estimate * cwnd_gain)

    This is explicitly NOT the trivialised `pacing_rate := 0` that
    iter-1 an automated prover substituted. The `cwnd_gain` cap is the workaround
    draft-ietf-ccwg-bbr-05 proposes for ACK aggregation; under
    `B > 2 * D`, the cap binds and `pacing_rate` saturates below the
    aggregation-inflated bandwidth estimate, producing the onset
    behaviour the theorem characterises. -/
