  BbrStarvation.Basic
  Types and constants for the BBRv3 finite-state abstraction.

  State vector and input event are small so the EBMC dual in
  `verilog/bbr3.sv` maps one-to-one. Each field is bounded so the state
  space is finite under k-induction at bound K = 64 RTTs.

  The four verification layers share this type hierarchy verbatim:
    - Lean 4 proofs close the theorems in `OnsetTheorem.lean`.
    - `scripts/lean_to_sv.py` emits the SystemVerilog dual.
    - Hypothesis strategies in `experiments/hypothesis_sweep.py` instantiate
      the `BBRState` / `AckEvent` algebraically.
    - The packet simulator (bundled in the replication package)
      runs the same transition function in Python.

    min-RTT filter is a `Fin W -> Real` function, indexed by age in RTTs.
    bw_filt is a parallel windowed max filter for the bandwidth
    estimate (draft-ietf-ccwg-bbr-05 §4.4). The all-time running max
    in `pacing_rate` alone was refuted in a counterexample construction
    because it makes the starvation predicate unreachable; adding a
    windowed max so old-sample contributions drain within `W` ticks
    is the fix. `phase : Fin 8` tracks the ProbeBW pacing-gain cycle.
