  BbrStarvation.Environment
  Closed-loop network environment for BBRv3 traces.

  In the paper's original Trace abstraction, the AckEvent schedule
  is a user-supplied `Nat -> AckEvent`. The open-loop counterexample
  class (found by the external prover on the original OnsetTheorem
  statements) pumps the windowed-max bandwidth filter with
  unbounded `delivered` values — which cannot happen in a physical
  network.

  This module adds an Environment type parameterising the
  bottleneck link and derives the AckEvent schedule as a function
  of the sender state + environment. The derived schedule
  automatically respects bottleneck capacity + causality; traces
  built over a ClosedLoopEnvironment are the physically realisable
  subset of open-loop traces.

  Target: the trace-level starves_within theorem holds over every
  ClosedLoopEnvironment + BBRv3 trace. See OnsetTheoremTrace.lean
  for the matching theorem signatures.

  This file ships with sorry-stubs; the sibling OnsetTheoremTrace
  carries the trace-level lemmas. Both close when the prover
  finishes the closed-loop proofs.

    `capacity` is the maximum delivery rate in bytes per unit wall-
    clock; `rtt` is the equilibrium round-trip time; `ack_delay`
    is a per-tick noise budget (set 0 for deterministic traces). -/

/-- Derive an AckEvent from the sender state + environment at
    tick `k`. Delivered bytes are capped at `capacity * rtt` and
    at the in-flight bytes the sender has outstanding. Wall-clock
    elapsed is the environment's RTT plus per-tick ack-delay noise. -/

    construction. -/
