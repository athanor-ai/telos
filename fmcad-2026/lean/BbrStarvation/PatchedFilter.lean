  BbrStarvation.PatchedFilter
  The positive companion to OnsetTheorem: a bandwidth filter F* that
  provably does NOT starve under the same B > 2D conditions that
  starve BBRv3's windowed-max filter.

  Design doc: (see `audit/` for design notes).

  Sketch:
    BBRv3 samples       sample_k  := delivered_k / (wall_clock_k + 1)
    F* samples          sample'_k := delivered_k / ((wall_clock_k + 1) * B_k)

  The only change is normalizing each sample by the observed ACK
  aggregation count B_k before feeding the windowed-max. Under this
  normalization, every non-zero ACK produces a sample' close to the
  true bottleneck rate (not inflated by aggregation). The windowed-
  max therefore never collapses to zero while the ACK stream is
  flowing.

  Proof obligations (per design doc):
    - sample'_positive: under nonzero delivered and finite B_k, sample' > 0.
    - filter_nonempty: windowed max over nonempty positive samples > 0.
    - no_starvation: composition of the above — pacing_rate > 0 for all n.

  All three start as `sorry` and are closed in subsequent commits
  (in lockstep with the Dafny + EBMC + Hypothesis + CPU-sim ports).

/-- Patched bandwidth update. Two-stage filter:
      (1) burst normalization — each delivered-rate sample is divided
          by `max a.burst_size 1` before the filter sees it, so the
          ACK aggregation regime cannot inflate the estimate;
      (2) EWMA replacement of the windowed-max — the pacing-rate
          state is an exponentially-weighted moving average with
          coefficient `alpha = 1 / W`. An EWMA never drops to zero
          on a single zero sample; after W consecutive zero samples
          it decays by a factor of at most `(1 - 1/W)^W ≈ 1/e ≈ 0.37`,
          never all the way to zero.

    The combination (1)+(2) makes `starved` unreachable under ANY
    schedule whose initial pacing_rate is positive, including the
    quiescent-window schedule that BBRv3's windowed-max falls to.
    This is the operative distinction between F* and the filter
    class the impossibility upgrade rules out — the impossibility
    class assumes bounded-window (memory-less) filters; F*'s
    memory is unbounded (EWMA has infinite support).

    Proof obligations are correspondingly refined:
      * `pacing_rate_positive_invariant`: if prior > 0, then
        `alpha*sample + (1-alpha)*prior > 0` for alpha < 1 and
        sample ≥ 0.
      * `no_starvation_under_F_star`: by induction on n, the
        invariant carries forward; starvation is unreachable.

/-- Lemma A: EWMA preserves strict positivity. If the prior
    pacing_rate is > 0, the sample ≥ 0, and alpha ∈ (0, 1),
    then `alpha * sample + (1 - alpha) * prior > 0`.

    Proof: `alpha * sample ≥ 0` (nonneg times nonneg), and
    `(1 - alpha) * prior > 0` (positive times positive), so the
    sum is strictly positive. -/

/-- Lemma B: the single-step update preserves pacing-rate positivity.
    Direct corollary of `ewma_preserves_positivity` with the specific
    alpha and sample arising from F*'s definition.

    Hypothesis refinement: `W > 1` is required so that `alpha = 1/W`
    is strictly less than 1 (the EWMA case `alpha = 1` collapses to a
    pure sample tracker whose positivity depends on the sample, not on
    the prior). `0 < s.cwnd_gain` is required because `cwnd_compute`
    scales the EWMA's output by the cwnd gain; if `cwnd_gain = 0` the
    resulting pacing_rate is 0 and the positivity claim is vacuous.
    Both hypotheses are satisfied by the IETF CCWG draft's default
    parameter regime (W = 10, cwnd_gain = 2). -/

/-- Main theorem. If the initial pacing_rate is positive, then for
    ALL n ≥ 0, the patched-filter trace's pacing_rate is strictly
    positive. Starvation (`pacing_rate = 0`) is unreachable.

    This holds UNCONDITIONALLY on the schedule — we don't need the
    non-quiescent hypothesis, because F*'s EWMA retains positive
    mass even through a W-tick zero-delivery window. Contrast with
    `OnsetTheorem.starves_within`, which proves BBRv3's windowed-max
    DOES starve under a quiescent window. Same state machine modulo
    one sub-step swap, opposite verdict. -/
