  BbrStarvation.OnsetTheoremTrace
  The trace-level formulation of the starvation onset theorem.

  Original version (OnsetTheorem.lean) was proved under the
  arithmetic-core framing after the trace-based lemmas were
  disproved on open-loop schedules (the counterexample class
  found in the external-prover run).

  This file revives the trace-level statement under a CLOSED-LOOP
  hypothesis: the schedule's `delivered` at every tick is bounded
  by the bottleneck-path's physical capacity and by the sender's
  in-flight bytes. Under that hypothesis the windowed-max filter
  cannot be pumped arbitrarily, and the original trace-level
  monotonicity + inflation + onset-upper/lower-bound lemmas hold.

  Target: zero sorry across this module. When closed, it provides
  the trace-level counterpart to the arithmetic-core theorems in
  OnsetTheorem.lean, closing the gap identified in §V Iteration 4.

  ── HYPOTHESIS-TIGHTENING NOTES ──
  The original five theorem statements turned out to be unprovable
  under closed_loop alone (a concrete counterexample: W = 1,
  capacity = 100, delivered = 50, which satisfies closed_loop yet
  increases pacing_rate from 0 to 37.5 in one step).

  Root cause: closed_loop bounds delivered by capacity × wall_clock
  and by inflight, but inflight is NEVER modified by the step
  function (it stays at t.init.inflight forever), so the bound
  is effectively constant. The windowed-max filter can still be
  pumped to capacity and held there by non-zero delivery samples.
  To drain pacing_rate to 0, the filter needs W CONSECUTIVE
  zero-delivery ticks so all W slots become zero.

  Each theorem therefore receives one or more additional hypotheses
  (marked `-- STATEMENT NEEDS:`) that capture the missing physical
  constraints. The added hypotheses are:

  • h_zero_window / h_consec_zeros: W consecutive zero-delivery
    ticks within the relevant window (models a quiescent period
    long enough to drain the windowed-max filter).
  • h_rate_le_cap + h_cap_le_BD: pacing_rate ≤ capacity ≤
    initial_rate × B/D (bounds the cwnd_compute gain chain).
  • h_pos_rate: pacing_rate stays positive before onset (the ACK
    stream sustains the filter before the quiescent window).

/-- Closed-loop schedule hypothesis: at every tick, the delivered-
    bytes count is bounded by the bottleneck-path capacity (in bytes
    per RTT) scaled by the wall-clock elapsed, and is also bounded by
    the sender's in-flight state. These two bounds encode the physical
    constraints on a closed-loop TCP trace that an open-loop Trace
    abstraction ignores.

    `capacity` is a new field we add as a bottleneck-rate parameter;
    it represents the maximum rate the sender can drain bytes through
    the bottleneck link. -/

    The BBRv3 `step` function is a composition of five sub-steps.

    and that the bw_filt update follows a simple shift-and-insert pattern.
    These lemmas support the key draining result: W consecutive
    zero-delivery ticks drain the windowed-max filter to zero. -/

    -- (counterexample: W = 1, capacity = 100, delivered = 50,
    -- initial pacing_rate = 0 → state(1).pacing_rate = 37.5 > 0).

    -- multiplier (up to 5/4 at phase 0). This hypothesis constrains
