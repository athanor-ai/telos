  BbrStarvation.MultiFlow
  Multi-sender starvation corollary of the single-flow onset theorem.

  Setup: N ≥ 1 BBRv3 senders share a single bottleneck link and the
  same PathParams (W, D, B). Each sender sees the same
  aggregation-burst structure up to a permutation of ACK
  allocations. Any subset of senders that each individually
  satisfy the single-flow hypotheses (B > 2D, D > 0) inherit the
  single-flow onset bound T(B,D) = (B/D − 2)·W + c from
  OnsetTheorem.starves_within.

  Corollary: there exists at least one sender whose starvation
  onset arrives within the single-flow horizon. Concretely, we
  bound min_i (onsetTime_i) by the single-flow onsetTime.

  The content of this module is the *lifting* from single-flow
  to N-flow: the arithmetic bound is inherited pointwise, and
  the minimum over a non-empty family is still bounded by the
  common bound.

/-- Multi-flow starvation bound: the arithmetic sandwich on onset
    time survives pointwise under the N-sender product. Proof is
    a direct application of OnsetTheorem.starves_within; no new
    mathematics is introduced. The multi-flow claim is therefore
    a corollary, not a new theorem. -/
